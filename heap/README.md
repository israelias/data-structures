## Heaps

### Heap Implementation
Heaps are typically implemented with a data structure such as an array or Python list. These sequential structures allow access to elements in a particular order which is key to efficient use of heaps. Although binary trees are helpful for understanding the relationships between nodes of a heap, implementation using a tree is less efficient for storage and retrieval of elements.

### Adding Elements: Heapify Up
When a new element is added to a heap, if heap properties are violated, the new child must swap with its parent until both child and root properties are restored. This process is called _heapifying up_, because of the upwards movement of the new element in this restorative process.

### Heaps as Binary Trees
A proper representation of a heap is a _complete binary tree_, which is a [tree](#trees) whose nodes have at most two children, and whose levels are filled completely from left to right (with no gaps in children). Itâ€™s possible for the last level to be semi-completely filled, but all of its nodes are as far left as possible.

### The Heap Class
The basis of a Heap class in Python is the implementation of a heap with a list, based on the parent-child relationships that a binary tree structure portrays. The class also consists of multiple methods that provide the functionality to construct these parent-child relationships in the list, add elements, remove the root element, and heapify in both directions when necessary.

```python
class MinHeap:
  "Some key methods to be included in the MinHeap class"
  
  def __init__(self):
    "Creates a list and count variable"
    self.heap_list = [None]
    self.count = 0
    
  def retrieve_min(self):
    "Replaces root with last child, calls .heapify-down()"
    
  def add(self, element):
    "Adds new element to heap_list, calls heapify_up()"
    
  def get_smaller_child_idx(self, idx):
    "Returns the child a parent should swap with"
    
  def heapify_up(self): 
    "Implements heapify up"
    
  def heapify_down(self):
    "Implements heapify down"
```
